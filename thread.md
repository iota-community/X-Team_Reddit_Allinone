# What should you know right now?


**DO NOT** share your IOTA Seed with websites, friends, moderators in the IOTA community or even IOTA Foundation members!

&nbsp;

**The Staking period has begun. You can now stake your tokens using the [Firefly wallet](https://firefly.iota.org)**.

**You will obtain Shimmer(SMR) and Assembly(ASMB) tokens**.

* **Shimmer** is the incentivized network for testing new features on IOTA, including smart contracts and the Coordicide.

* **Assembly** is a permissionless protocol to build, connect and deploy smart contracts on a feeless multi-chain network.

**Learn more about the relationship between the 3 networks [Here](https://blog.iota.org/iota-shimmer-assembly/)**

**Ledger hardware wallet support in Firefly is [available now](https://blog.iota.org/announcing-ledger-nano-support-in-firefly/)**:

* [General Use Guide for Ledger Nano with Firefly](https://blog.iota.org/general-use-guide-for-ledger-nano-with-firefly/)

**The [IOTA 2.0 DevNet](https://v2.iota.org/) (Nectar) has been released!**

In short, the IOTA 2.0 DevNet release is the beta version of Coordicide.
It's a full implementation of our Coordicide modules on an incentivized testnet.

# What is IOTA?

**IOTA** is a feeless and scaleable transaction settlement and data transfer layer with a focus on the Internet of Things (IoT). It is based on a novel distributed ledger technology called the **tangle**, that uses the structure of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) instead of a blockchain which can overcome the inefficiencies of current blockchain designs and introduces a new way of reaching consensus in a decentralized peer-to-peer system.

... and [this](https://explorer.iota.org/mainnet/visualizer/) is how it looks!
