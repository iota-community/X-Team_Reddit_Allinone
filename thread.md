**Before, during and after the migration KEEP YOUR SEED SAFE!**

# What is IOTA?

**IOTA** is a feeless and scaleable transaction settlement and data transfer layer with a focus on the Internet of Things (IoT). It is based on a novel distributed ledger technology called the **tangle**, that uses the structure of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) instead of a blockchain which can overcome the inefficiencies of current blockchain designs and introduces a new way of reaching consensus in a decentralized peer-to-peer system.

... and [this](https://explorer.iota.org/mainnet/visualizer/) is how it looks!
