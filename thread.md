# What should you know right now?


**DO NOT** share your IOTA Seed with websites, friends, moderators in the IOTA community or even IOTA Foundation members!

**The Staking period continues. You can now stake your tokens using the [Firefly wallet](https://firefly.iota.org)**.

**You will obtain Assembly(ASMB) tokens**.

* **Assembly** is a permissionless protocol to build, connect and deploy smart contracts on a feeless multi-chain network.

**Learn more about the relationship between the 3 networks [Here](https://blog.iota.org/iota-shimmer-assembly/)**

# What is IOTA?

**IOTA** is a feeless and scaleable transaction settlement and data transfer layer with a focus on the Internet of Things (IoT). It is based on a novel distributed ledger technology called the **tangle**, that uses the structure of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) instead of a blockchain which can overcome the inefficiencies of current blockchain designs and introduces a new way of reaching consensus in a decentralized peer-to-peer system.

... and [this](https://explorer.iota.org/mainnet/visualizer/) is how it looks!
